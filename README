Class-Method-Modifiers 0.05

Class::Method::Modifiers is a lightweight module that lets you easily "just"
modify methods. The ideas are stolen directly from Stevan Little's Moose (which
borrows heavily from the universally-acclaimed CLOS and Perl 6). The
implementation is straight out of my noggin, though.

MAJOR CHANGES
    0.03: C3 should work now
          support for multiple modifiers of the same kind in one class

    0.02: support for multiple modifiers in one class
    0.01: first version
